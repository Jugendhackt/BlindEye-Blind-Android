# BlindEye
A next-level navigation app for blind people to help them get around the world.

#### What exactly do you mean with "helping blind people"?
We wanted to make an app that helps people to find their way in cities.

**Example:** _You are blind. You want to go to the supermarket. You  don't know where obstacles are._

**That's where BlindEye comes in:**
BlindEye is made of two Applications - one for non-disabled-people and one for blind people.
The non-disabled or *non-blind*-people use the **BlindEye Assist**-App for adding, removing or editing obstacles on a map.
<br>
The blind people launch the **BlindEye Blind**-App and whenever there's an obstacle within 50m it warns them
using TTS (Text-To-Speech).
